# openapi-mock

See:

- https://github.com/theganyo/swagger-node-runner/issues/118
- https://github.com/theganyo/swagger-node-runner/pull/119

This currently demonstrates setting up a basic mock server using:

- [swagger-node-runner](https://github.com/theganyo/swagger-node-runner)
- [sway](https://github.com/apigee-127/sway)

I may turn this in to a CLI tool to start a mock server from a given spec file.
